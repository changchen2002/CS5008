# ðŸ’¥ LeetCode-Portfolio# Mock Technical Interview Portfolio



This repository is for your Mock Technical Interview module. It includes solutions to 8 LeetCode problems solved in C, along with a live coding video submission for one of the problems. 

The goal is to build a GitHub portfolio with your coding skills and showcase your abilities in live coding, problem-solving, and understanding algorithm complexities.

## ðŸ’¥  Problem List

Solve the following LeetCode problems in C:

1. [148. Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
2. [147. Insertion Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/)
3. [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
4. [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
5. [1834. Single-Threaded CPU](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-threaded-cpu/)
6. [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)
7. [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)
8. [105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)

## ðŸ’¥  Submission Instructions

1. **Live Coding Video**: Record yourself solving ONE of the LeetCode problems live. Upload the video in `.mp4` format and place it in the `videos/` directory.
2. **Code Submission**: Solve all the problems and upload your `.c` files in the `solutions/` folder.
3. **GitHub Setup**: Organize your solutions and video files as follows:
    - Each solution should be in a separate `.c` file.
    - Each `.c` file should have a comment at the top with your name and the link to the corresponding LeetCode problem.
  
   Example comment header in `.c` file:
    ```c
    /*
      Name: [Your Name] 
      LeetCode Problem: [Problem Link]
    */
    ```

4. **File Structure**:
   - `solutions/` â€“ A folder containing all the `.c` solution files.
   - `videos/` â€“ A folder for your live coding video in `.mp4` format.


## ðŸ’¥Submission Checklist

- **Live Coding Video**: [live_coding_video.mp4](./videos/live_coding_video.mp4)
- - Your retrospective.pdf file should be uploaded to the Gradescope.


## ðŸ’¥ Notes

- Your retrospective.pdf file should be uploaded to the Gradescope.
- Ensure that the solution code is properly commented, and that each `.c` file includes the appropriate header.
- All files should be committed to your repository. **No late submissions will be accepted.**
- This will be your opportunity to build a strong portfolio of LeetCode problem-solving using C.

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing your work!
